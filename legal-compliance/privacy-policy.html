Introduction</h5><p>Welcome to the Dharitri project (the &quot;Project&quot;). This Privacy Policy describes how Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd, a company registered in India (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Dugong,&quot; &quot;the Company,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;), collects, uses, shares, and protects your personal information when you (&quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; or &quot;User&quot;) visit our website located at [YourWebsiteAddress.com] (the &quot;Website&quot;), use our staking platform at stake.dharitri.org (the &quot;Staking Platform&quot;), interact with our content, or contact us. The Project is known by the name &quot;Dharitri.&quot;</p><p>The data controller responsible for your personal information is Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd, with a registered address at P&amp;26/P, NAVYA THE GRAND, 1-179/27, Patancheru, Rameshwar Banda, Hyderabad, Telangana 502319, India.</p><p><strong>Important Note on Project Structure:</strong> The Dharitri Foundation referenced in our project materials does not yet exist as a legal entity and holds no current legal responsibility. All current operations and data processing are conducted by Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd.</p><p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and strive to comply with applicable Indian data protection laws, including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (DPDPA), as well as international data protection standards where applicable. This Privacy Policy applies to the Website, our Staking Platform, and our current informational services. Please note that the future Dharitri platform and its associated applications, as outlined in our Project Roadmap, will involve the collection and processing of different types of data. Detailed privacy information specific to that platform will be provided at the time of its launch, potentially under updated or supplementary privacy notices. The Dharitri Project may in the future be operated or governed in part by the Dharitri Foundation, once legally established in Kenya, or another designated entity; any such change affecting data control will be communicated through updates to this policy or other official notices.</p><h5>2. Information We Collect</h5><p>We collect information in the following ways:</p><h5>Information You Provide to Us:</h5><p><strong>Contact Forms:</strong> When you contact us through forms on our Website (e.g., for general inquiries or partnership information), we collect the information you choose to provide. This may include your name, email address, and optionally, your phone number, along with the content of your message. These forms are processed on our behalf by Tally.so, a third-party service provider. We encourage you to review Tally.so&#x27;s privacy policy for information on their data handling practices, available on their website.</p><p><strong>Staking Platform (stake.dharitri.org):</strong> When you access our Staking Platform to stake pREWA tokens, we collect your wallet address to facilitate staking operations. Staking parameters (APY, lockup periods, minimum amounts) are displayed on the platform and sourced from smart contract configurations. All staking transactions are recorded on the Binance Smart Chain and become part of the public blockchain record that cannot be modified or deleted.</p><h5>Information We Collect Automatically:</h5><p><strong>Website Visitors:</strong></p><p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our Website and hold certain information. For detailed information about the types of cookies we use (including strictly necessary, performance/analytics, and marketing/targeting cookies), the specific cookies deployed, their purposes, and how you can manage your cookie preferences, please refer to our separate Cookie Policy, which forms part of this Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>Log Data and Analytics:</strong> When you visit our Website, your browser automatically sends information that we, or our third-party analytics providers such as Google Analytics, collect. This information may include your computer&#x27;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Website that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This data is generally aggregated and used for analytical purposes to improve our Website.</p><p><strong>Staking Platform Users:</strong></p><ul><li>Wallet Connection Data: When you connect your wallet to our Staking Platform, we temporarily collect your wallet address and may cache transaction history for display purposes.</li><li>Staking Preferences: Information about your staking choices, including amounts, duration, and reward preferences.</li><li>Smart Contract Interaction Logs: Technical data related to your interactions with our staking smart contracts.</li></ul><h5>Information Regarding pREWA Token:</h5><p>The acquisition of pREWA tokens takes place on third-party decentralized exchanges, such as PancakeSwap. Dugong does not directly process these financial transactions or collect personal financial information related to such purchases through this Website. Your interactions with these third-party platforms, including any wallet addresses used, are subject to their terms and the public nature of the Binance Smart Chain.</p><p>Dugong does not currently conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks or collect such personal information directly through this Website or Staking Platform for individuals interested in the pREWA token.</p><h5>Future Platform Data (Forward-Looking Statement):</h5><p>Please be aware that the future Dharitri platform, as outlined in our Project Roadmap, is designed to empower smallholder farmers. This will involve the collection by Dugong (or a future designated project entity like the Dharitri Foundation) of specific information from participating farmers and agents, such as Farmer IDs (including optional photos), farm activity data, conservation records, and potentially geospatial data. Sensitive data collected in the future will be subject to enhanced consent and security protocols, detailed in platform-specific notices. The collection of such data will always be based on explicit user consent, for specific service delivery purposes, and will be governed by detailed privacy notices provided at the time of that platform&#x27;s launch.</p><h5>3. How We Use Your Information</h5><p>Dugong uses the information we collect for various purposes:</p><ul><li>To provide, operate, and maintain our Website and Staking Platform.</li><li>To improve, personalize, and expand our Website and Staking Platform.</li><li>To understand and analyze how you use our Website and Staking Platform.</li><li>To respond to your inquiries, questions, and comments when you contact us through our forms.</li><li>To facilitate staking operations and smart contract interactions.</li><li>To display staking parameters and calculate rewards.</li><li>To comply with applicable legal obligations.</li><li>For security purposes, including to detect, prevent, and address technical issues, fraud, or security risks.</li><li>As stated in our Cookie Policy for information collected via cookies.</li></ul><p><strong>Marketing and Project Updates:</strong> Information you provide through our contact forms will be used solely to respond to your direct inquiry. We do not currently use this information for unsolicited marketing communications. We may offer you the option to subscribe to project updates or newsletters in the future, for which we will obtain your explicit consent if you choose to subscribe.</p><h5>4. Sharing Your Information</h5><p>Dugong does not sell your personal information. We may share your personal information collected through this Website and Staking Platform in the following situations:</p><h5>With Service Providers:</h5><p>We may share your personal information with third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Website and Staking Platform, to provide website hosting, to process data submitted through forms, and to perform other services on our behalf. These include:</p><ul><li>Tally.so: For processing contact form submissions.</li><li>Google Analytics: For website analytics.</li><li>HostArmada: For website hosting.</li><li>Blockchain Infrastructure Providers: For smart contract deployment and interaction.</li></ul><p>These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are expected to comply with data protection obligations.</p><h5>Blockchain Transactions:</h5><p>Staking activities involve smart contract interactions that are permanently recorded on public blockchains. While we don&#x27;t share your personal information with third parties, your wallet addresses and transaction details become part of the public Binance Smart Chain record, which is accessible to anyone through blockchain explorers and cannot be modified or deleted.</p><h5>For Legal Requirements:</h5><p>Dugong may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency). We may also disclose your information in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p><ul><li>Comply with a legal obligation applicable to Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd.</li><li>Protect and defend the rights or property of Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd or the Dharitri Project.</li><li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Website or Staking Platform.</li><li>Protect the personal safety of users of the Website, Staking Platform, or the public.</li><li>Protect against legal liability.</li></ul><h5>Future Platform Data Sharing (Forward-Looking Statement):</h5><p>For the future Dharitri platform, any sharing of farmer or agent data (e.g., with partner NGOs, Cooperatives for verification, or with Microfinance Institutions for loan applications based on farmer consent) will occur only with explicit user consent, for specific, disclosed purposes, and will be detailed in that platform&#x27;s specific privacy notices at that time.</p><h5>5. Data Security and Blockchain Considerations</h5><p>Dugong takes reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><h5>Data Breach Notification:</h5><p>In the event of a data breach that poses risks to user rights and freedoms, we will notify affected users and relevant regulatory authorities within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach (GDPR requirements) or 48 hours (Kenya DPA requirements), as applicable.</p><h5>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Specific Considerations:</h5><ul><li><strong>Blockchain Transaction Permanence:</strong> Please be aware that blockchain transactions are permanent and publicly viewable. We cannot modify or delete transaction records once they are confirmed on the blockchain. Your wallet address and staking activities will be visible to anyone who can access blockchain explorers.</li><li><strong>Smart Contract Security:</strong> While we implement security best practices in our smart contracts, the decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that smart contract interactions carry inherent risks that cannot be completely eliminated.</li><li><strong>Private Key Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for the security of your private keys and wallet access. We do not have access to your private keys and cannot recover lost access to your wallet.</li><li><strong>Open Source Software:</strong> Our project utilizes open-source software under GPL v3 license, including our blockchain fork of MultiversX and newly developed code. While this doesn&#x27;t directly affect personal data, users should be aware that project code will be publicly available for review and audit.</li></ul><h5>6. Data Retention</h5><p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p><ul><li><strong>Website Analytics Data:</strong> Information collected for website analytics (e.g., through Google Analytics) is retained for a standard period as configured within our analytics tools, or as long as necessary for analytical purposes to help us understand how visitors use our Website.</li><li><strong>Contact Form Submissions:</strong> We will retain information submitted through our contact forms (including your name, email address, and any optional phone number or message you provide) for as long as necessary to address your inquiry and for a reasonable period thereafter for our internal record-keeping, typically not exceeding 24 months after the last communication, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</li><li><strong>Staking Platform Data:</strong> Wallet addresses and staking preferences are retained as long as you maintain active stakes or for 12 months after your last staking activity, whichever is longer.</li><li><strong>Blockchain Data:</strong> Data recorded on blockchain networks is permanent and cannot be deleted by us or any other party.</li><li><strong>Cookie Data:</strong> The retention period for data collected via cookies varies depending on the type of cookie. Please see our Cookie Policy for more detailed information on cookie duration.</li></ul><p>Once the retention period expires, personal data shall be appropriately disposed of or anonymized. The rights to access, erasure, rectification, and data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the relevant retention period if the data has been deleted. Note that blockchain-recorded data cannot be deleted regardless of retention periods.</p><h5>7.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity before responding to such requests. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law.</p><h5>8. International Data Transfers</h5><p>Your information, including personal data collected through this Website and Staking Platform, may be transferred to ‚Äî and maintained on ‚Äî computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.</p><p>Specifically, by using our Website and Staking Platform and submitting information through them, you acknowledge that your data may be processed in:</p><ul><li><strong>India:</strong> Where our data controller, Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd, is located and where our Website is hosted (via HostArmada in an Indian datacenter).</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> Where Tally.so, our form processing provider, may store form data.</li><li><strong>Other locations globally:</strong> Where our third-party service providers, such as Google Analytics, may process data according to their global infrastructure (this may include the United States of America).</li><li><strong>Decentralized blockchain networks:</strong> Where transaction data is distributed across global nodes on the Binance Smart Chain network.</li></ul><p>If you are located outside India and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to India and process it there, as well as in other locations as described.
