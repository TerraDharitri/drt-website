      <h5>Service Description</h5>
      <p>
        The Website provides information about the Dharitri Project, our mission
        to empower smallholder farmers through sustainable agriculture and
        finance, our phased Project Roadmap, our team, and the pREWA token. The
        pREWA token is a BEP20 utility token on the Binance Smart Chain intended
        to fund the development and growth of the Dharitri platform and
        ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Open Source Commitment:</strong> Core platform code, including
        our blockchain infrastructure and key platform components, will be
        released under GPL v3 or similar open-source licenses. Contributors to
        our repositories must comply with applicable license terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Website may provide links or information regarding the acquisition
        of pREWA tokens, which occurs on third-party decentralized exchanges
        (e.g., PancakeSwap). Dugong does not directly facilitate these financial
        transactions through this Website. The Website may also provide
        information regarding the pREWA staking program available at
        stake.dharitri.org; however, actual participation in staking is governed
        by separate Staking Terms and Conditions available on the staking
        platform, which you must agree to separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Smart Contract Interactions:</strong> Use of our staking
        platform involves interactions with smart contracts on blockchain
        networks, which carry inherent technological risks and are irreversible
        once executed.
      </p>

      <h5>5. pREWA Token</h5>
      <h5>Nature of pREWA</h5>
      <p>
        pREWA is a BEP20 utility token on the Binance Smart Chain, designed to
        provide a means to support the funding of the Dharitri Project's
        platform development and ecosystem growth. pREWA is not intended to
        represent any share, security, equity, or debt instrument, nor does it
        grant any rights to profit-sharing or governance in the traditional
        financial sense, except as may be explicitly defined for the future
        native REWA token as per project documentation.
      </p>

      <h5>Acquisition via Third-Party Platforms</h5>
      <p>
        The pREWA token may be available for acquisition on third-party
        decentralized exchange platforms such as PancakeSwap. Dugong does not
        own, control, or operate these third-party platforms. Your use of such
        platforms is at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of
        those platforms. You are solely responsible for conducting your own due
        diligence and for the security of your wallet and any transactions you
        undertake.
      </p>

      <h5>No Refunds</h5>
      <p>
        All acquisitions of pREWA tokens made on third-party decentralized
        exchanges are final and non-refundable by Dugong. Transactions on
        decentralized exchanges are, by their nature, generally irreversible.
      </p>

      <h5>Comprehensive Risk Disclosure</h5>
      <p>
        The pREWA token, like all cryptocurrencies, involves significant risks
        including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Extreme Price Volatility:</strong> Token values can fluctuate
          dramatically and unpredictably
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> Government authorities may
          classify tokens differently over time, potentially affecting their
          legal status, taxation, or usability
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:</strong> Technical bugs,
          exploits, or failures in smart contract code may result in permanent
          loss of tokens
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blockchain Network Risks:</strong> Network congestion,
          failures, forks, or attacks may affect token functionality
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technology Risks:</strong> Wallet malfunctions, private key
          loss, or software incompatibilities
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Market Risks:</strong> Lack of liquidity, trading
          manipulation, or exchange failures
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Operational Risks:</strong> Project development delays, team
          changes, or business model pivots
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Total Loss Risk:</strong> You may lose your entire investment
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please review our "Disclaimers" page [Link to Your Disclaimers Page] for
        additional important risk information before acquiring or interacting
        with pREWA tokens.
      </p>

      <h5>Bridge to REWA Token (Highly Speculative)</h5>
      <p>
        Dugong intends for the Dharitri Project to offer a mechanism to bridge
        pREWA tokens to a future native REWA token upon the successful launch of
        the Dharitri mainnet, as outlined in project documentation. However,
        this plan is highly speculative. The development, launch, and specifics
        of such a bridge are subject to technical feasibility, regulatory
        approval, project progress, and other factors, and are not guaranteed.
        There is no assurance that the REWA token will ever be developed or
        launched.
      </p>

      <h5>6. pREWA Staking</h5>
      <p>
        Dugong may offer a pREWA staking program through the Dharitri Project at
        stake.dharitri.org. Participation in any pREWA staking program is
        entirely voluntary and will be subject to separate "Staking Terms and
        Conditions" available on the designated staking platform, which you must
        read and agree to before participating in the staking program. These
        main Terms of Service do not govern the specifics of staking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Staking Risks:</strong> Staking involves locking tokens in smart
        contracts for specified periods during which they cannot be accessed.
        Staking carries significant risks including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Smart contract failures or vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Loss of access to tokens during lockup periods</li>
        <li>Changes to staking parameters including APY rates</li>
        <li>Technical failures preventing token withdrawal</li>
        <li>Slashing or penalty mechanisms that may reduce token holdings</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>7. Intellectual Property Rights</h5>
      <h5>Website Content</h5>
      <p>
        The Website and its entire contents, features, and functionality
        (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays,

      <h5>"Dharitri" Project Identifiers</h5>
      <p>
        The name "Dharitri" as used for this Project, the Dharitri logo, and all
        related names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans
        are identifiers used by Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd in connection
        with the Dharitri Project. While "Dharitri" may not be a registered
        trademark at the time of these Terms, Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd
        asserts its common law rights in these identifiers in relation to the
        Project. You must not use such marks in a way that suggests affiliation
        with or endorsement by us, or in any way that is likely to cause
        confusion, without the prior written permission of Dugong Global
        Services Pvt Ltd.
      </p>

      <h5>Platform Code & Open Source</h5>
      <p>
        The Dharitri L1 Blockchain is being developed as a fork of the
        MultiversX blockchain, which is licensed under the GNU General Public
        License v3.0 (GPL v3). Consistent with this foundation, substantial
        portions of the new code developed by Dugong for the Dharitri Project's
        platform components (such as backend systems, mobile applications, and
        future smart contracts as outlined in our Project Roadmap) are intended
        to be released under the GPL v3 or a similarly approved open-source
        license. The specific open-source license applicable to each component
        will be made available with the release of that component's source code.
        This open-source commitment applies to the functional code of the
        platform; certain website design elements, proprietary documentation
        created by Dugong, or specific internal tools may remain proprietary
        unless explicitly licensed otherwise.
      </p>

        social media platforms, Google Analytics, HostArmada).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Enhanced Third-Party Platform Warnings:</strong> PancakeSwap and
        other decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are unregulated platforms. Common
        risks include fraud, significant price slippage, technical failures,
        smart contract vulnerabilities, and loss of funds. Dugong does not
        audit, verify, or endorse these platforms or their security measures.
        Users interact with these platforms entirely at their own risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dugong has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the
        content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or
        services. You further acknowledge and agree that Dugong shall not be
        responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss
        caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or
        reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through
