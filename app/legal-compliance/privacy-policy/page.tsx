      <h5>1. Introduction</h5>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Dharitri project (the "Project"). This Privacy Policy
        describes how Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd, a company registered in
        India (hereinafter referred to as "Dugong," "the Company," "we," "us,"
        or "our"), collects, uses, shares, and protects your personal
        information when you ("you," "your," or "User") visit our website
        located at [YourWebsiteAddress.com] (the "Website"), use our staking
        platform at stake.dharitri.org (the "Staking Platform"), interact with
        our content, or contact us. The Project is known by the name "Dharitri."
      </p>
      <p>
        The data controller responsible for your personal information is Dugong
        Global Services Pvt Ltd, with a registered address at P&26/P, NAVYA THE
        GRAND, 1-179/27, Patancheru, Rameshwar Banda, Hyderabad, Telangana
        502319, India.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important Note on Project Structure:</strong> The Dharitri
        Foundation referenced in our project materials does not yet exist as a
        legal entity and holds no current legal responsibility. All current
        operations and data processing are conducted by Dugong Global Services
        Pvt Ltd.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and strive to comply with
        applicable Indian data protection laws, including the Digital Personal
        Data Protection Act 2023 (DPDPA), as well as international data
        protection standards where applicable. This Privacy Policy applies to
        the Website, our Staking Platform, and our current informational
        services. Please note that the future Dharitri platform and its
        associated applications, as outlined in our Project Roadmap, will
        involve the collection and processing of different types of data.
        Detailed privacy information specific to that platform will be provided
        at the time of its launch, potentially under updated or supplementary
        privacy notices. The Dharitri Project may in the future be operated or
        governed in part by the Dharitri Foundation, once legally established in
        Kenya, or another designated entity; any such change affecting data
        control will be communicated through updates to this policy or other
        official notices.

      <p>
        <strong>Contact Forms:</strong> When you contact us through forms on our
        Website (e.g., for general inquiries or partnership information), we
        collect the information you choose to provide. This may include your
        name, email address, and optionally, your phone number, along with the
        content of your message. These forms are processed on our behalf by
        Tally.so, a third-party service provider. We encourage you to review
        Tally.so's privacy policy for information on their data handling
        practices, available on their website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Staking Platform (stake.dharitri.org):</strong> When you access
        our Staking Platform to stake pREWA tokens, we collect your wallet
        address to facilitate staking operations. Staking parameters (APY,
        lockup periods, minimum amounts) are displayed on the platform and
        sourced from smart contract configurations. All staking transactions are
        recorded on the Binance Smart Chain and become part of the public
        blockchain record that cannot be modified or deleted.
      </p>

      <h5>Information We Collect Automatically:</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Website Visitors:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We use cookies and
        similar tracking technologies to track activity on our Website and hold
        certain information. For detailed information about the types of cookies
        we use (including strictly necessary, performance/analytics, and
        marketing/targeting cookies), the specific cookies deployed, their
        purposes, and how you can manage your cookie preferences, please refer

        type, browser version, the pages of our Website that you visit, the time
        and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device
        identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This data is generally
        aggregated and used for analytical purposes to improve our Website.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Staking Platform Users:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>

          transaction history for display purposes.

      <h5>Information Regarding pREWA Token:</h5>
      <p>
        The acquisition of pREWA tokens takes place on third-party decentralized
        exchanges, such as PancakeSwap. Dugong does not directly process these
        financial transactions or collect personal financial information related
        to such purchases through this Website. Your interactions with these
        third-party platforms, including any wallet addresses used, are subject
        to their terms and the public nature of the Binance Smart Chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dugong does not currently conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money
        Laundering (AML) checks or collect such personal information directly
        through this Website or Staking Platform for individuals interested in
        the pREWA token.
      </p>

      <h5>Future Platform Data (Forward-Looking Statement):</h5>
      <p>
        Please be aware that the future Dharitri platform, as outlined in our
        Project Roadmap, is designed to empower smallholder farmers. This will
        involve the collection by Dugong (or a future designated project entity
        like the Dharitri Foundation) of specific information from participating
        farmers and agents, such as Farmer IDs (including optional photos), farm
        activity data, conservation records, and potentially geospatial data.
        Sensitive data collected in the future will be subject to enhanced
        consent and security protocols, detailed in platform-specific notices.
        The collection of such data will always be based on explicit user
        consent, for specific service delivery purposes, and will be governed by
        detailed privacy notices provided at the time of that platform's launch.
      </p>

        in the following situations:
      </p>

      <h5>With Service Providers:</h5>
      <p>
        We may share your personal information with third-party service
        providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Website and Staking

        only as necessary to provide these services to us and are expected to
        comply with data protection obligations.
      </p>

      <h5>Blockchain Transactions:</h5>
      <p>
        Staking activities involve smart contract interactions that are
        permanently recorded on public blockchains. While we don't share your
        personal information with third parties, your wallet addresses and
        transaction details become part of the public Binance Smart Chain
        record, which is accessible to anyone through blockchain explorers and
        cannot be modified or deleted.
      </p>

      <h5>For Legal Requirements:</h5>

        Dugong may disclose your personal information if required to do so by
        law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a
        court or a government agency). We may also disclose your information in
        the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
      </p>

          or the public.

      </ul>

      <h5>Future Platform Data Sharing (Forward-Looking Statement):</h5>
      <p>
        For the future Dharitri platform, any sharing of farmer or agent data
        (e.g., with partner NGOs, Cooperatives for verification, or with
        Microfinance Institutions for loan applications based on farmer consent)
        will occur only with explicit user consent, for specific, disclosed
        purposes, and will be detailed in that platform's specific privacy
        notices at that time.
      </p>

      <h5>5. Data Security and Blockchain Considerations</h5>
      <p>
        Dugong takes reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security
        measures to protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse,
        and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
        However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the
        Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive
        to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
        information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <h5>Data Breach Notification:</h5>
      <p>
        In the event of a data breach that poses risks to user rights and
        freedoms, we will notify affected users and relevant regulatory
        authorities within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach (GDPR
        requirements) or 48 hours (Kenya DPA requirements), as applicable.
      </p>

      <h5>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Specific Considerations:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Blockchain Transaction Permanence:</strong> Please be aware
          that blockchain transactions are permanent and publicly viewable. We
          cannot modify or delete transaction records once they are confirmed on
          the blockchain. Your wallet address and staking activities will be
          visible to anyone who can access blockchain explorers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Smart Contract Security:</strong> While we implement security
          best practices in our smart contracts, the decentralized nature of
          blockchain technology means that smart contract interactions carry
          inherent risks that cannot be completely eliminated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Private Key Responsibility:</strong> You are solely
          responsible for the security of your private keys and wallet access.
          We do not have access to your private keys and cannot recover lost
          access to your wallet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Open Source Software:</strong> Our project utilizes
          open-source software under GPL v3 license, including our blockchain
          fork of MultiversX and newly developed code. While this doesn't
          directly affect personal data, users should be aware that project code
          will be publicly available for review and audit.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>6. Data Retention</h5>
      <p>
        We will retain your personal information only for as long as is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Website Analytics Data:</strong> Information collected for
          website analytics (e.g., through Google Analytics) is retained for a
          standard period as configured within our analytics tools, or as long
          as necessary for analytical purposes to help us understand how
          visitors use our Website.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact Form Submissions:</strong> We will retain information
          submitted through our contact forms (including your name, email
          address, and any optional phone number or message you provide) for as
          long as necessary to address your inquiry and for a reasonable period
          thereafter for our internal record-keeping, typically not exceeding 24
          months after the last communication, unless a longer retention period
          is required or permitted by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Staking Platform Data:</strong> Wallet addresses and staking
          preferences are retained as long as you maintain active stakes or for
          12 months after your last staking activity, whichever is longer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blockchain Data:</strong> Data recorded on blockchain networks
          is permanent and cannot be deleted by us or any other party.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cookie Data:</strong> The retention period for data collected
          via cookies varies depending on the type of cookie. Please see our
          Cookie Policy for more detailed information on cookie duration.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once the retention period expires, personal data shall be appropriately
        disposed of or anonymized. The rights to access, erasure, rectification,
        and data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the
        relevant retention period if the data has been deleted. Note that
        blockchain-recorded data cannot be deleted regardless of retention
        periods.
      </p>

      <h5>7. Your Data Protection Rights</h5>
      <p>
        Depending on your location and applicable data protection laws, you may

          <strong>The right to erasure (right to be forgotten):</strong> You

        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The right to withdraw consent:</strong> If we are relying on
          your consent to process your personal information, you have the right
          to withdraw that consent at any time.
        </li>
      </ul>

        blockchain networks (including staking transactions and wallet
        addresses) cannot be modified, deleted, or restricted by us or any other

      </p>
      <p>
        To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at
        privacy@dharitri.org. We may need to request specific information from
