                This Cookie Policy explains how Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd ("Dugong," "we," "us," or "our"), operating the project known as "Dharitri," uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website [YourWebsiteAddress.com] (the "Website") and our staking platform at stake.dharitri.org (the "Staking Platform"). It describes what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Cookie Policy should be read in conjunction with our [Link to Your Privacy Policy Page] ("Privacy Policy"), which provides more detailed information about our data processing practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                We strive to comply with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR requirements for European users and other international standards for cookie usage.
            </p>

            <h5>2. What Are Cookies?</h5>
            <p>
                Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device by websites that you visit. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cookies can be "session" cookies (which are deleted once you close your web browser) or "cookies that stay until you delete them" (also called "persistent" cookies). They can also be "first-party" cookies (set by the website you are visiting, i.e., by Dugong for the Dharitri Website) or "third-party" cookies (set by a domain other than the one you are visiting, e.g., by Google Analytics).
            </p>

            <h5>3. How and Why We Use Cookies</h5>
            <p>
                Dugong uses cookies on the Dharitri Website and Staking Platform for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To ensure our Website and Staking Platform function correctly and securely</li>
                <li>To understand how our services are used, which helps us improve performance and user experience</li>
                <li>To remember your preferences (such as your cookie consent choices and wallet connections)</li>
                <li>To remember your staking preferences and transaction history on our Staking Platform</li>
                <li>To provide enhanced security through CSRF protection and session management</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>4. Types of Cookies We Use</h5>
            <p>

Strictly necessary cookies include CSRF tokens to prevent form hijacking â€“ disabling them breaks form submissions and wallet connections.

            <p>
                <strong>Consent:</strong> These cookies do not require your consent as they are essential for the operation of our services.

                <li>Session cookies for website and staking platform security</li>
                <li>Wallet connection state cookies</li>
                <li>Form security tokens</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>4.2 Performance and Analytics Cookies</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> These cookies collect information about how you use our Website and Staking Platform, such as which pages you visit most often, how much time you spend on those pages, staking activity patterns, and if you encounter any error messages. The information collected is typically aggregated and anonymous and helps us improve how our services work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Website and Staking Platform. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our services (including your IP address, which is anonymized) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers that may be located outside of your country of residence. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our services, compiling reports on activity for us, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can learn more about Google's practices by going to https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners/, and opt-out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
