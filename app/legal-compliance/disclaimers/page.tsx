                <strong>⚠️ CRITICAL ENTITY NOTICE</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The "Dharitri Foundation" (Kenya) referenced in project materials does not currently exist as a legal entity. All legal responsibilities, liabilities, and operations rest solely with Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd (India). Any future transition to other entities will be clearly communicated.
            </p>

            <h5>1. General Information Only</h5>
            <p>
                The information provided on the website [YourWebsiteAddress.com] (the "Website"), in project documentation such as the Whitepaper and Project Roadmap, and in any other communications originating from Dugong Global Services Pvt Ltd ("Dugong," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our") relating to the project known as "Dharitri" (the "Project Information") is for general informational purposes only. Accessing the Website or reviewing Project Information does not create any form of professional relationship with Dugong.
            </p>

            <h5>2. No Financial, Investment, Legal, or Tax Advice</h5>
            <p>
                Dugong, its team members, advisors, and affiliates are not providing financial advice, investment advice, legal advice, tax advice, or any other professional advice through the Website or other Project Information. All Project Information is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation, endorsement, offer, or solicitation to buy, sell, stake, or hold pREWA tokens, REWA tokens, or any other cryptocurrency, token, digital asset, or financial instrument.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engaging with cryptocurrencies involves substantial risk. You must conduct your own thorough research and due diligence, and consult with qualified, independent financial, legal, and tax advisors who are familiar with your personal circumstances before making any decisions related to the pREWA token or any other cryptocurrency based on Project Information. Do not rely solely on the Project Information provided by Dugong.
            </p>

            <h5>3. pREWA Token and Cryptocurrency Risks</h5>
            <h5>High-Risk Nature</h5>
            <p>
                pREWA tokens, like all cryptocurrencies, are highly speculative and involve extreme risk of financial loss, including the potential for total loss of all funds used to acquire them.
            </p>

            <h5>Critical Risk Warnings</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extreme Volatility:</strong> pREWA value can crash 100% within minutes. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously unstable and unpredictable.</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction Finality:</strong> pREWA transactions on DEXs are FINAL. Dugong cannot reverse trades, recover lost private keys, or compensate for scams, fraud, or user errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Private Key Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for securing your private keys. Lost keys = lost tokens permanently. Dugong has no access to your private keys and cannot recover lost access.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility Token Nature:</strong> pREWA is intended as a utility token to help fund the development and growth of the Dharitri Project's platform and ecosystem. Its value is not guaranteed and is not directly tied to the success or profitability of Dugong or the Dharitri Project in a manner that implies an investment return in the traditional financial sense.</li>
                <li><strong>No Guarantee of Profit or Value:</strong> There is no guarantee or promise that pREWA will increase or maintain its value or that holders will achieve any financial return.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Acquisition Risks:</strong> pREWA is acquired through third-party decentralized exchange platforms (e.g., PancakeSwap). Dugong does not control these platforms or transactions conducted on them. Users are solely responsible for their own security and due diligence when using such platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Classification:</strong> Changes in regulatory interpretation could reclassify pREWA in ways that affect its legal status, taxation, or usability.</li>
                <li><strong>Not a Security:</strong> pREWA tokens are not intended to constitute securities, shares, equities, bonds, or any form of traditional investment instrument in any jurisdiction.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Kenya Regulatory Advisory</h5>
            <p>
                The Capital Markets Authority Kenya warns that crypto assets are unregulated high-risk products. Acquiring pREWA may violate local investor protection guidelines. Kenyan residents should exercise extreme caution and verify legal compliance before acquiring any cryptocurrency.
            </p>

            <h5>4. Staking Risks</h5>
            <h5>Live Parameter Disclaimer</h5>
            <p>
                Staking rewards displayed on stake.dharitri.org are real-time estimates only. Dugong reserves the right to alter APY rates, lockup periods, minimum requirements, or terminate staking programs entirely without advance notice. Historical returns do not indicate future results.
            </p>

            <h5>Staking-Specific Risks</h5>
            <p>
                If Dugong, through the Dharitri Project, offers a pREWA staking program, participation involves significant risks, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:</strong> Even audited smart contracts carry risks of bugs, exploits, or failures that could result in permanent loss of staked funds</li>
                <li><strong>Lock-up Periods:</strong> Tokens may be inaccessible for extended periods, preventing you from selling during market downturns</li>
                <li><strong>APY Variability:</strong> Staking rewards are not guaranteed and can change dramatically or cease entirely</li>
                <li><strong>Slashing/Penalties:</strong> Potential penalties for early unstaking or validator misbehavior</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Failures:</strong> Smart contract malfunctions, network issues, or platform failures could result in loss of staked tokens or rewards</li>
                <li><strong>Platform Risk:</strong> The staking platform (stake.dharitri.org) could become unavailable or discontinued</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Users should understand these risks before participating in any staking program and review any specific Staking Terms and Conditions provided.
            </p>

            <h5>5. Forward-Looking Statements</h5>
            <p>
                Project Information may contain "forward-looking statements" regarding future plans, development timelines, platform features, token utility, market performance, partnerships, and other projections concerning the Dharitri Project. These statements are based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs of Dugong, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances.
            </p>

            <h5>Specific Future Project Disclaimers</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>REWA Token Bridge:</strong> Plans to bridge pREWA to a future native REWA token are highly speculative and not guaranteed. Technical feasibility, regulatory approval, and project progress may prevent implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>COME Stablecoin:</strong> The planned COME stablecoin is conceptual only – no gold reserves, currency baskets, or banking partnerships have been secured. Development may never occur.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Actual results, performance, or achievements of the Dharitri Project may differ materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Dugong undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Users should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
            </p>

            <h5>6. Project Under Development</h5>
            <p>
                The Dharitri Project platform and its associated services and features are currently under active development by Dugong. There is no guarantee that all described features will be implemented, or that they will be implemented according to any specific timeline. The development process is iterative, and features, functionalities, and user interfaces may change significantly or be abandoned entirely.
            </p>

            <h5>Future Entity Transition</h5>
            <p>
                The Dharitri Project may in the future be operated by the Dharitri Foundation (once established in Kenya) or other entities. Such transitions could materially affect project operations, user relationships, token functionality, and legal responsibilities.
            </p>

            <h5>7. Accuracy and Completeness of Information</h5>
            <p>
                While Dugong strives to provide accurate and up-to-date Project Information, it makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability with respect to the Website or the Project Information for any purpose. Any reliance users place on such information is therefore strictly at their own risk.
            </p>

            <h5>8. Third-Party Information, Statistics, and Links</h5>
            <h5>Third-Party Data</h5>
            <p>
                Project Information may include data, statistics, or statements obtained from third-party sources. While Dugong believes these sources to be reliable, it has not independently verified all such information and does not guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Such information is provided for general informational context only.
            </p>

            <h5>Third-Party Links & Services</h5>
            <p>
                The Website may contain links to third-party websites or services, and the Project may rely on third-party services (e.g., PancakeSwap, Tally.so, HostArmada, Google Analytics). Dugong has no control over, and assumes no responsibility or liability for, the content, privacy policies, practices, availability, security, or performance of any third-party websites or services. The inclusion of any links or mention of third-party services does not necessarily imply a recommendation or endorse the views expressed or services provided. You access and use such third-party services at your own risk.
            </p>

            <h5>9. Technological Risks</h5>
            <p>
                The use of blockchain technology, smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, digital wallets, decentralized applications, and internet-based services inherently involves significant technological risks. These risks include, but are not limited to:
            </p>

            <h5>Blockchain and Smart Contract Risks</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transaction Irreversibility:</strong> All blockchain transactions are permanent and cannot be undone, modified, or reversed by anyone</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Contract Failures:</strong> Bugs, vulnerabilities, or exploits in smart contracts may result in permanent loss of funds</li>
                <li><strong>Network Risks:</strong> Blockchain network congestion, failures, forks, or attacks may affect functionality</li>
                <li><strong>Gas Fee Volatility:</strong> Transaction costs on blockchain networks can fluctuate dramatically</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Technical Infrastructure Risks</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Software bugs and hardware failures</li>
                <li>Network congestion or outages</li>
                <li>Malicious attacks (phishing, hacking, denial-of-service)</li>
                <li>Security vulnerabilities and data loss</li>
                <li>Wallet compatibility and functionality issues</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Open Source Software Risks</h5>
            <p>
                Our GPL v3 fork inherits upstream risks from MultiversX blockchain code. Independent security audits cannot eliminate all smart contract failure possibilities. Open source code is publicly available and modifiable, which may introduce additional security considerations.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Dugong will implement reasonable security measures for its own systems related to the Dharitri Project, it cannot guarantee the security or integrity of the Website, the future platform, or any associated technologies.
            </p>

            <h5>10. Regulatory Environment</h5>
            <p>
                The regulatory landscape for blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and token offerings is evolving, uncertain, and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Regulatory risks may be particularly significant in emerging economies where laws are evolving rapidly, including Kenya where future operations are planned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Changes in laws, regulations, enforcement actions, or interpretations by governmental or regulatory authorities could materially and adversely affect the pREWA token, the future REWA token, the planned COME stablecoin, the Dharitri platform, or Dugong's ability to operate or achieve the objectives of the Dharitri Project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users are solely responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable regulations in their own jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions may prohibit or restrict cryptocurrency activities entirely.
            </p>

            <h5>11. Team and Project Information</h5>
            <p>
                Information provided about the Dharitri Project team, their roles, project timelines, and roadmap objectives are based on current plans and information available at the time of publication by Dugong. These details are subject to change without notice as the Project evolves and circumstances dictate. Team composition, roles, and project direction may change significantly.
            </p>

            <h5>12. No Guarantee of Project Success</h5>
            <p>
                The Dharitri Project is an early-stage endeavor with no guarantee of success. There is no guarantee that the Project will achieve its stated goals or that its platform will be successfully developed, launched, adopted, or generate any value. Participation in or support of the Dharitri Project and its pREWA token is highly speculative and may result in total loss.
            </p>

            <h5>13. Seek Independent Advice</h5>
            <p>
                You are strongly urged to seek independent professional advice (including financial, investment, legal, and tax advice) tailored to your specific circumstances before making any decision based on, or related to, Project Information or the pREWA token.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not make investment decisions based solely on information provided by Dugong or the Dharitri Project. Consult qualified professionals who understand your personal financial situation and local regulatory requirements.
            </p>
